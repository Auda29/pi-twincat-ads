# Local Dev Test

Use this when you want to exercise the built package directly against a real PLC before wiring it into a Pi host instance.

If you want to test the real Pi packaging layer instead, use the same JSON config file and start Pi with `--plc-config ./local.config.json`.

## 1. Build the package

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## 2. Create a local config file

Example `local.config.json`:

```json
{
  "connectionMode": "router",
  "targetAmsNetId": "192.168.1.120.1.1",
  "targetAdsPort": 851,
  "readOnly": true,
  "contextSnapshotSymbols": [
    "MAIN.someValue"
  ]
}
```

For direct mode, also include `routerAddress`, `routerTcpPort`, `localAmsNetId`, and `localAdsPort`.

## 3. Run the local smoke test

Read-only example:

```bash
npm run smoke:local -- --config ./local.config.json --symbol MAIN.someValue --watch-symbol MAIN.someValue
```

Optional write test:

```bash
npm run smoke:local -- --config ./local.config.json --symbol MAIN.someValue --watch-symbol MAIN.someValue --enable-write --write-symbol MAIN.safeWriteValue --write-value 1
```

Only use the write path when all of the following are true:

- `readOnly` is set to `false` in the config
- the symbol is listed in `writeAllowlist`
- the target symbol is operationally safe to change

## 4. Run through Pi itself

Once the package is built and installed in Pi, start it with the same config:

```bash
pi --plc-config ./local.config.json
```

The packaged adapter reads the PLC config from:

- `--plc-config`
- `PI_TWINCAT_ADS_CONFIG`
- `PI_TWINCAT_ADS_CONFIG_JSON`

## 5. What the script does

The runner uses the built package from `dist/` and executes this sequence:

1. `register()`
2. `session_start`
3. `before_agent_start`
4. `context`
5. `plc_state`
6. `plc_list_symbols`
7. `plc_read`
8. `plc_read_many`
9. `plc_watch`
10. `plc_list_watches`
11. optional `plc_set_write_mode` and `plc_write`
12. `plc_unwatch`
13. `session_end`

All results are printed as formatted JSON.

## 6. Failure clues

- Connection failures usually point to route, AMS Net ID, router, or port issues.
- `failedSnapshots` usually means one or more `contextSnapshotSymbols` are wrong or stale.
- Write rejections usually mean `readOnly`, runtime write mode, or `writeAllowlist` is blocking the operation.
- Missing watch updates usually mean the symbol path is wrong or the PLC is not producing notification changes.
