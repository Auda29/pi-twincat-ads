# TwinCAT ADS Skill

Use this skill when the agent needs to inspect TwinCAT PLC, NC, or IO runtime values over ADS, or safely manipulate explicitly allowed PLC symbols.

## Recommended workflow

1. Start with `plc_state`.
2. Use `plc_list_symbols` if the exact symbol path is not certain.
3. Use `plc_describe_symbol` when type, size, array bounds, or struct members matter.
4. Use `plc_list_groups` and `plc_read_group` when the config defines reusable PLC symbol groups.
5. Use `nc_state`, `nc_list_axes`, `nc_read_axis_position`, `nc_read_axis_status`, `nc_read_axis`, or `nc_read_error` when the task concerns NC axes, motion state, position, velocity, status flags, or NC errors.
6. Use `io_list_groups`, `io_read`, `io_read_many`, or `io_read_group` when the task concerns configured IO process data, sensors, valves, safety inputs, or outputs.
7. Use `tc_state`, `tc_event_list`, `tc_runtime_error_list`, or `tc_log_read` when the task concerns a specific TwinCAT-wide runtime diagnostic surface rather than one PLC symbol, NC axis, or IO data point.
8. Use `tc_diagnose_errors` or `tc_diagnose_runtime` for bounded first-pass triage when the user asks for a compact error or runtime health overview.
9. Use `plc_read` or `plc_read_many` before making decisions.
10. Use `plc_wait_until` for a specific PLC state transition or condition; use `plc_watch` for ongoing PLC observation.
11. Only use `plc_write` after checking state, symbol path, and write permissions.
12. Use `plc_list_watches` to inspect current subscriptions and avoid duplicates.
13. Pay attention to hook-provided `failedSnapshots` if configured context symbols could not be read.

## Tool guidance

### Discovery and reads

- Prefer `plc_list_symbols` for discovery.
- Use `plc_describe_symbol` after discovery when a symbol's shape matters:
  - array dimensions or indexing
  - struct fields or nested members
  - PLC type names, byte size, or metadata
  - validating that a symbol is the intended target before a write
- Prefer `plc_read_many` when several related values are needed together.
- Use `plc_state` to understand runtime mode, watch count, and current write availability.
- If hooks return `failedSnapshots`, treat that as a configuration or PLC-symbol drift hint and verify the symbol names.

### Symbol groups

- Use `plc_list_groups` to inspect configured PLC symbol groups.
- Use `plc_read_group` when a group captures a meaningful machine snapshot, such as state, mode, active step, alarms, or axis status.
- Symbol groups are not created by `plc_list_groups` or `plc_read_group`.
- Symbol groups are created in the Pi/TwinCAT ADS config under `services.plc.symbolGroups`.
- If the user asks to create or change a group, propose the config edit and explain that the Pi extension must load that updated config before the tools can list or read the group.
- A group is a named list of exact PLC symbol paths, for example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "plc": {
      "symbolGroups": {
        "machine": ["MAIN.State", "MAIN.Mode", "MAIN.ActiveStep"],
        "axisX": ["MAIN.AxisX.Status", "MAIN.AxisX.Position"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Do not invent group names. Call `plc_list_groups` first unless the user or config context already gives an exact group name.
- If a group read fails for one symbol, treat that as useful drift information and verify symbol names with `plc_list_symbols` or `plc_describe_symbol`.
- A good group name is short and task-oriented, for example `machine`, `axisX`, `alarms`, `cycle`, or `safetyInputs`.
- Build groups from symbols you have verified through `plc_list_symbols`, `plc_describe_symbol`, or successful reads.

### NC axes

- NC access is read-only in this package.
- Use `nc_state` to verify the configured NC ADS service state before relying on axis reads.
- Use `nc_list_axes` to inspect configured axes. Do this before `nc_read_axis` unless the user or config context already gives an exact axis name or ID.
- Use `nc_read_axis_position` for one configured axis when you only need position, velocity, state double word, or online-state values.
- Use `nc_read_axis_status` for one configured axis when you only need flags such as ready, referenced, in-position, or busy.
- Use `nc_read_axis` as a best-effort aggregate when you need position, velocity, status flags, state double word, and error code together. If optional status or error fields cannot be read, inspect its `warnings` and still use available online-state values.
- Use `nc_read_axis_many` when comparing several configured axes.
- Use `nc_read_error` when the task is focused on an NC or axis error.
- NC axes must be configured under `services.nc.axes` with at least `name` and `id`. Optional fields are `targetAdsPort` and `description`.
- A minimal NC config looks like:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "nc": {
      "targetAdsPort": 500,
      "axes": [
        { "name": "X", "id": 1 },
        { "name": "Y", "id": 2 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- Do not invent axis IDs. Ask for the configured axis name/ID or use `nc_list_axes`.
- Treat NC status and error reads as diagnostics. Follow-up actions such as PLC reads or writes must be separate, deliberate tool calls.

### IO data points

- IO access is read-only in this package.
- Use `io_list_groups` to inspect configured IO groups and data points.
- Use `io_read` for one configured IO data point.
- Use `io_read_many` when several IO values are needed together.
- Use `io_read_group` when the config defines a meaningful IO snapshot such as `inputs`, `outputs`, `safety`, `valves`, or `sensors`.
- IO data points must be configured under `services.io.dataPoints` with `name`, `indexGroup`, `indexOffset`, and `type`. Optional fields are `size` and `description`.
- IO groups are configured under `services.io.groups` as lists of configured data point names.
- A minimal IO config looks like:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "io": {
      "targetAdsPort": 300,
      "dataPoints": [
        {
          "name": "Input1",
          "indexGroup": 61472,
          "indexOffset": 128000,
          "type": "BOOL"
        }
      ],
      "groups": {
        "inputs": ["Input1"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Do not invent raw IO addresses. If a needed data point is missing, explain the config entry that would be required.
- IO reads return decoded values plus raw hex. Use raw hex when type decoding looks suspicious or when checking bit-level process data.

### TwinCAT runtime diagnostics

- Use `tc_state` for a compact TwinCAT-wide view across ADS services, PLC state, NC state, and diagnostic source capabilities.
- Use `tc_event_list` for recent TwinCAT/Event Log messages with filters such as `limit`, `since`, `severity`, `contains`, and `source`.
- Use `tc_runtime_error_list` when the task is specifically about runtime/system errors. It defaults to critical/error severities unless the caller provides another severity filter.
- Use `tc_log_read` for bounded runtime log text from configured log sources.
- Use `tc_diagnose_errors` when the user asks for a compact error triage. It combines runtime errors, recent events, and a small runtime log tail with explicit limits and filters.
- Use `tc_diagnose_runtime` when the user asks for a compact runtime health overview. It combines TC state, PLC state, NC state, IO config state, and active runtime errors.
- Prefer the individual commands when the user already names the exact state, event, log, NC axis, IO data point, or PLC symbol to inspect.
- Do not treat the combo commands as global dump tools. Keep `limit`, `logLimitBytes`, `logTailLines`, `since`, `severity`, and `contains` narrow when using them.
- Diagnostic sources are configured under `diagnostics.eventSources` and `diagnostics.logSources`.
- The default local source uses the Windows `Application` Event Log filtered for TwinCAT/Beckhoff provider names when available.
- If a diagnostic result has `available=false`, report the capability reason instead of treating it as a PLC failure.
- Do not use these runtime diagnostic tools for XAE build output, Engineering error lists, or Visual Studio output windows; those belong to the later Engineering phase.

### Finding symbol paths

- Users often describe a variable by meaning, not by its full ADS symbol path.
- If the user says something like "check variable `xEnable` in block `FB_Axis`", do not guess the final path immediately.
- First search with `plc_list_symbols` using narrow filters based on the most specific pieces you have:
  - variable name such as `xEnable`
  - block or DUT name such as `FB_Axis`
  - program or GVL name if mentioned, such as `MAIN` or `GVL`
- Prefer refining in small steps instead of using a very broad filter once.
- Once matching symbols are listed, use the exact returned symbol path for `plc_read`, `plc_read_many`, `plc_watch`, or `plc_write`.

Example workflow:

- User says: "Check the value of variable `xResetLog` in the block `PRG_SPS_Ablauf_Anl1`."
- First try `plc_list_symbols` with a filter like `xResetLog`.
- If there are many matches, refine with `PRG_SPS_Ablauf_Anl1`.
- A returned symbol might be `PRG_SPS_Ablauf_Anl1.L_xResetLog` or `PRG_SPS_Ablauf_Anl1.fbLogger.xResetLog`.
- Then use that exact full path in `plc_read`.

Heuristics for common TwinCAT naming:

- Top-level program variables often look like `MAIN.someValue` or `PRG_Name.someValue`.
- Global variables often start with a GVL name such as `GVL_System.someValue`.
- Nested function block members often look like `MAIN.fbAxis.xEnable` or `PRG_Name.fbUnit.stStatus.xReady`.
- Array elements can appear as `GVL.Axis[1].Cmd`.
- Exact casing matters, especially for writes and allowlists.

### Writes

- Treat every write as safety-sensitive.
- Writes are blocked unless all of the following are true:
  - config `readOnly` is `false`
  - runtime write mode was explicitly enabled with `plc_set_write_mode`
  - the symbol is in `writeAllowlist`
- If a write is denied, inspect `plc_state` and the symbol name before retrying.

### Watches

- Use `plc_watch` when repeated polling would be wasteful.
- Default watch behavior is `on-change`.
- A fresh watch can already expose an initial `lastValue` and `lastTimestamp` when ADS provides `latestData`.
- Use `plc_unwatch` when the observation is no longer needed.
- Use `plc_list_watches` before creating duplicate observation plans.

### Waiting for conditions

- Use `plc_wait_until` when the user asks to wait for a specific PLC condition, transition, or readiness state.
- Prefer `plc_wait_until` over manual polling loops when there is a clear condition and timeout.
- Prefer `plc_wait_until` over `plc_watch` when you only need to know when a condition becomes true once.
- Prefer `plc_watch` when the user wants ongoing monitoring, repeated updates, or a reusable subscription.
- Use `stableForMs` when transient values should not count, for example waiting until a ready bit has stayed true for 500 ms.
- Use `anyOf` for alternatives and `allOf` for combined readiness checks.
- Keep timeouts bounded and operationally reasonable. If the wait times out, report the last observed values and suggest the next read or diagnostic step.
- `plc_wait_until` waits only. Follow-up actions such as reads, diagnostics, or writes must be separate tool calls after the wait result is known.

Example condition:

```json
{
  "condition": {
    "allOf": [
      { "name": "MAIN.AxisReady", "operator": "equals", "value": true },
      { "name": "MAIN.ActiveError", "operator": "equals", "value": false }
    ]
  },
  "timeoutMs": 30000,
  "stableForMs": 500
}
```

## Symbol naming

- Expect TwinCAT PLC symbols in forms like `MAIN.varName`, `GVL.Axis[1].Cmd`, or nested DUT paths.
- Prefer exact symbol names returned by discovery instead of guessing.
- Write allowlist matching is exact and case-sensitive.

## Safety rules

- Do not assume write access just because `plc_write` exists.
- Do not enable runtime writes unless there is a clear operational reason.
- Read machine-relevant state before changing motion, process, or safety-adjacent values.
- If PLC state looks unexpected, stop and inspect rather than retrying writes aggressively.
